# Profile Card Project

This is a simple **Profile Card** project built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It demonstrates fundamental web development techniques including **CSS positioning**, **DOM manipulation**, and **JavaScript interactivity**.

## Project Overview

The **Profile Card** layout features:
- A **profile picture** with a slight overlap effect.
- The **name** and **description** of the profile.
- A dynamically generated **list of hobbies**.
- A **toggle button** to show/hide the profile card.
- **Age category** based on the user's age.

### **Key Features**
1. **CSS Positioning**:
   - The profile card is **centered** both horizontally and vertically using **Flexbox**.
   - The **profile picture** is positioned **absolutely** to overlap slightly with the card using `position: absolute`.

2. **JavaScript Interactivity**:
   - Data is stored in a **JavaScript object** (profile data).
   - **Dynamic content** like hobbies are displayed from an array.
   - A **button** is used to **toggle visibility** of the profile card.
   - **Age category** is determined based on the profile's age.
