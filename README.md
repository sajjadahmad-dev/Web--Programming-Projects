Profile Card Project
A simple profile card implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases the use of CSS positioning techniques, DOM manipulation, and interactive features using JavaScript.

Project Overview
This profile card layout features:

A profile picture with an overlapping effect.
The name and description of the profile.
A list of hobbies dynamically populated from an array.
A button to toggle the visibility of the profile card.
An age category determined dynamically based on the age provided.
Key Features:
CSS Positioning:
The profile card is centered both horizontally and vertically using flexbox.
The profile picture is positioned absolutely to overlap the card slightly at the top.
JavaScript Interactivity:
Data is stored in a JavaScript object and dynamically inserted into the HTML.
Hobbies are displayed in a list, iterating through an array.
The visibility of the profile card can be toggled using a button.
The age category is displayed based on the age property using a function.
Files:
index.html: Contains the structure of the webpage.
styles.css: Styles for the profile card, positioning, and overall layout.
